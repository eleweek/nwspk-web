%p
  Applications for our 2025-26 course
  %strong Introduction to Political Technology
  are now open!
%p The course is designed to support mid-career technologists develop a holistic understanding of the civic landscape in the UK, in order to found groundbreaking new projects or seek strategic positions in key institutions.
%p The course has run since 2015 and has graduated 80 fellows. It entails a commitment of approximately 16 hours per week and is designed to fit around a day job, particularly if remote or flexible. Originally it was fully residential with participants living in Newspeak House itself, but due to popular demand the course has grown and the majority of course participants now live off campus.
%p You will spend a year immersed in a wide range of communities working to change society with technology, including government, activism, charities, journalism, and research, and benefit from the expertise and guidance of our multi-disciplinary faculty.

%h2 Introducing the 2024 Cohort
= image_tag('2024-cohort.png')
%p
  We are thrilled to welcome our latest cohort of fellowship candidates for the 2024 program. They bring a wealth of experience and deep expertise, from space law and digital identity systems to parliamentary advocacy and AI-powered campaigning.
%p  
  Hailing from 11 countries and collectively speaking more than 15 languages, these emerging leaders bring a global and diverse perspective to some of our most pressing political technology challenges. Seven will be joining us as residents, immersing themselves fully in the Newspeak House environment, while eight will contribute as non-residents, ensuring a dynamic mix of perspectives and approaches. We look forward to the groundbreaking ideas, collaborations, and projects that will emerge from this exceptional group of thinkers and doers.
