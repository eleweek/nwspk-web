%h2 Welcome to the 2024 Cohort
= image_tag('2024-cohort.png')
%p
  We are thrilled to welcome our latest cohort of fellowship candidates for the 2024 program. They bring a wealth of experience and deep expertise, from space law and digital identity systems to parliamentary advocacy and AI-powered campaigning.
%p  
  Hailing from 11 countries and collectively speaking more than 15 languages, these emerging leaders will bring a global and diverse perspective to some of our most pressing political technology challenges. Seven will be joining us as residents, immersing themselves fully in the Newspeak House environment, while eight will contribute as non-residents, ensuring a dynamic mix of perspectives and approaches. We look forward to the groundbreaking ideas, collaborations, and projects that will emerge from this exceptional group of thinkers and doers.
