<h2>Library</h2>

<p>Newspeak House's official library is the <a href="https://civictech.guide/">Civic Tech Field Guide</a>, the worldâ€™s largest collection of political technology projects. It's an <a href="https://directory.civictech.guide/">open knowledge-base of over 10,000 projects</a> using tech, data, and design for the public interest.</p>

<p>Newspeak Fellowship Candidates help curate and add projects they find over the course of their research. By doing so they not only contribute what they find to the digital commons, but also create a repository of the things they and their colleagues discover over the course of the year. Fellowship Candidates also use the Field Guide to inform their own coursework and thesis prototypes.</p>

<p>You can contribute new projects or improve existing entries to the Field Guide here:
